                            Welcome to my portfolio! First things first, if you must know anything
                            about me, you should know I am a HUGE fan of pizza, dogs, and of course,
                            graphic design. I have a B.S. from Kansas State University (Go Cats) in
                            Apparel Marketing and I have a minor in Business Administration. Wait,
                            what?? Apparel, fashion? You read that right, I worked in a t-shirt store
                            doing graphic design, where I fell in love with clothing. However, my heart
                            is in content, graphic design, and writing. Any way we can find a way to
                            combine it all? 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            A little nerd at heart, I grew  up teaching myself how to use programs
                            like Paint (LOL), GIMP (props if you know what this is), HTML and CSS
                            coding, and ran a "button/graphics" page on Neopets when I was in
                            middle school. In high school I moved on to better things, like the
                            Adobe Suite and I haven't looked back. 
                        </p>    
                        <p> 
                            When I'm not working, I like to update my Spotify playlists,
                            find new smoothie or tea places, keep up-to-date with sports,
                            and watch anything that will make me laugh. If you need anything
                            at all, don't hesitate to contact me using the contact link --I'd
                            love to hear from ya! Enjoy scrolling through what projects I've
                            been up to and feel free to stay awhile.
